You are in the Sovereign Stack Management Environment (SSME). From here, you can issue several commands:

    ss-remote  - Take a remote SSH endpoint under management of Sovereign Stack.
    ss-reset   - The opposite of ss-remote; de-provisions an existing remote.
    ss-up      - Instantiate a deployment to your active project according to your
                 various remote.conf, project.conf, and site.conf files.
    ss-down    - Reverses ss-up. Takes the active project down. Non-destructive of user data,
                 unless you provide the --purge flag.
    ss-update  - This is just ss-down then ss-up.
    ss-show    - show the incus resources associated with the current remote.
